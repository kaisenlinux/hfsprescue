DESCRIPTION
       Hfsprescue scans a damaged image file or partition that is formatted with HFS+. You can restore your files and directories, even when it's not possible to mount it with  your  operating  system.  Your
       files  and  directories  will be stored in the directory './restored' in your current directory. The HFS+ file or partition will not be changed. So you need enough space to copy out the files from the
       HFS+ file system. Hfsprescue supports HFS+ compression (resource fork).

       You find a complete reference, depending on your installation, in '/usr/share/hfsprescue', '/usr/local/share/hfsprescue' or '/opt/share/hfsprescue' in English and German as HTML, PDF and TEXT.

RESTORING FILES
       You have to complete 6 steps to restore your files:

       1) Scan for your files.

       hfsprescue -s1 <device node|image file>
    			[-b <block size>]
    			[-o <offset in bytes>]
    			[-d <working / destination directory>]
    			[-f|--force]

       2) Cleanup file database.

       hfsprescue -s2 [--utf8len <value 1 to 5>] 
                      [--future-days <days>] 
                      [-d <working directory>]

       3) Restore your files.

       hfsprescue -s3 <device node|image file>
    			[-b <block size>]
    			[-o <offset in bytes>]
    			[-d <working directory>]
    			[--vh-file <file name>]
    			[--eof-file <file name>]
    			[-c <file number>]
    			[--file-list <file name>]
    			[--alternative]

       4) Restore your directory structure.

       hfsprescue -s4 [-d <working directory>]

       5) Move the restored files to the correct directories.

       hfsprescue -s5 [-d <working directory>]

       6) Last step, finalize and cleanup.

       hfsprescue -s6 [-d <working directory>] [-k]

       Hfsprescue will guide you through every step and is telling you the command for the next step.

       --utf8len <value 1 to 5>
	      Set the allowed maximum char length of an UTF-8 char. File names that have invlaid chars will be removed. Values from 1 to 5 are allowed. 1 is the default value and should be fine. For file names with asian chars use 2. The values 3-5 shou

       --future-days <days>
	      Set the allowed tollerance for future file dates. The default value is 7 days. Files with a date more in the future will be removed. Usually, those files are false detection.

       -d <working directory>
    	      Use the directory instead of the current working directory.

       o STEP 3: Restore your files.

       -s3 <device node|image file>
              Run step 3. You have to tell the device node or image file.

    	      Use the directory instead of the current working directory.

       --alternative
              Find a new name when the file already exists in it's directory. Can happen with older versions or deleted files.

       o STEP 4: Restore your directory structure.

       -s4    Run step 4.

       -d <working directory>
    	      Use the directory instead of the current working directory.

       -s6    Run step 6.

       -k     Keep mkdir.sh and hfsprescue_dir_id.tmp files.

       -d <working directory>
    	      Use the directory instead of the current working directory.

       o FIND FILE BYTES AND/OR AN UNICODE STRING: Find data on sectors.

              This parameter lists all files that have been found. You can run this after you completed Step 2.

       --slash
              Mac OS X allows the char '/' in file names in the GUI. For directory compatibility, '/' is converted to ':'. Use --slash when you want to display the '/' in the file name instead of ':'.  Maybe
              when you search a file name which has '/'.

       --one-file  <device node|image file>  <file number>
              You have to tell the device node or image file and the file number of the requested file. Both parameters are required.

       -b <block size>
              Set the block size in bytes. Useful when the boot sector has been lost.

       -o <offset>
              Set the start offset of the partition in bytes. Useful when the partition table is lost or damaged.

       -d <working directory>
    	      Use the directory instead of the current working directory.

       --alternative
              Find a new name when the file already exists in it's directory. Can happen with older versions or deleted files.

       o FIND EXTENTS OVERFLOW FILE: Scan the device for possible start blocks.

       --find-eof <device node|image file>
              You have to tell the device node or image file.

              Start search from offset.

       --first
              Just show the first HFS+ Volume Header and quit.

       -f, --force
              Show Volume Header even when the lastMountVersion field reports another OS than Mac OS X or Linux.

       -v, --verbose
              Display detailed informations.

EXAMPLE RESTORE COMMAND SEQUENCE
       There are 6 Steps to complete.

       hfsprescue -s1 /dev/sdb2

       hfsprescue -s2 /dev/sdb2

       hfsprescue -s3 /dev/sdb2

       hfsprescue -s4

       hfsprescue -s5

       hfsprescue -s6

PARTITION START OFFSET CALCULATION FORMULA
       You find a detailed description with an example on https://www.plop.at or in the hfsprescue.txt and hfsprescue.pdf

       offset = byte_search_result - list_start_block * block_size

       o Note:

       Use --list to get the file start block (list_start_block) of the requested file.
              Example: hfsprescue --list|grep PerfectPicture.jpg

       Use --find and -ff to search for the reference file and get the byte_search_result value.
              Example hfsprescue --find /dev/sdb -ff PerfectPicture.jpg 2000

BUGS
       Unicode to UTF-8 conversion is not fully supported. There are problems with accents on non Mac OS X systems. When you restore on another system than Mac OS X, then the accents should be corrected when
       you copy the restored files to a HFS+ file system.

       This bug will be fixed maybe in a further version.
