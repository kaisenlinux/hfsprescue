    Elmar Hanlhofer:
    
    * Configure script fix for OSX. OS detection in configure.ac to do not

      the current working directory.

2017/03/31 3.3 by Elmar Hanlhofer

    * Additional valid file name check with UTF-8 encoding rules.
    
    * -s2 does not need the parameters of -s1. The parameters of -s1 are now
      stored in a file and loaded to inform the user about the parameters
      for -s3.
    
    * -s2: New parameter --future-days <days> 
      Used for false file detection. Files with a creation date in the future
      are ignored.
      Default value is 7. 

    * -s2: New parameter --utf8len <1 to 5>
      Used for false file name detection. When you don't have file names with
      asian chars, then you don't have to use this option. The default value 1. 
      Use 2 when you have asian file names.
      The values 3 to 5 should not be used.
      
    * --find: -ff allows now multiple file search at once. The number of bytes 
      is now the first parameter of -ff. The other parameters are the file
      names until '-' is detected.
    
    * CSV export: Column "Invalid start block" added.
    
    * List files: Flags _F_EOF_, _F_COMPRESSED_ and _F_INVALID_START_BLOCK_
